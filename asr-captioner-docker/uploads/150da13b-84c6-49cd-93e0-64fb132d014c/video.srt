00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,620
I wonder who's the easiest one to read
in EN. My guess is it's gonna be Kiara.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,900
Kiara is my first guess. If we ever did
play a game with Kiara, I feel like
she'd

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,900
be so easy to read. You just hear her
giggling be like, hey, but depending on

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,360
how she giggles, you'd know she was
lying or trying to play it up.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,560
Kiara, this would be really funny.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,520
Kiara erect you in Connect 4, so
probably not so easy.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,740
Connect 4 takes a different set of
skills.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,060
Different set of skills.

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,680
Bye bye, everybody! Peace!
